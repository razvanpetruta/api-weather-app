# Node.js projects

Using node.js, express and APIs I was able to build two basic projects.

## Weather app

In this app I used [OpenWeatherMap api](https://openweathermap.org/api) and basically
 you can enter your city and find information about the current weather.

## Newsletter signup

For this one I used [Mailchimp api](https://mailchimp.com/developer/) to make a signup page
that collects emails.
